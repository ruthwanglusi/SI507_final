## Project Description

This project visualizes the US national parksâ€™ location on a  choropleth map in web browser using Flask. The project will allow users to see the density of national parks in 51 states of the US. Click on the map to access a full list of national parks at the clicked state (also accessible by directly type in URLs). Update the density choropleth map as user filter through various park types.

## How to run

1. First, you should ... (e.g. install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. Second, you should ... (e.g. run `python programname.py runserver` or whatever else is appropriate)
3. Anything else

## How to use

1. A useful instruction goes here
2. A useful second step here
3. (Optional): Markdown syntax to include an screenshot/image: ![alt text](image.jpg)

## Routes in this application
- `/home` -> The overall national park density among all the US states visualized as a choropleth map.
- `/state/(state name)` -> A list of all the national parks in a specific state.
- `/type/(park type)` -> The density of a specific park type across all US states as a choropleth map.

## How to run tests
1. First... (e.g. access a certain directory if necessary)
2. Second (e.g. any other setup necessary)
3. etc (e.g. run the specific test file)
NOTE: Need not have 3 steps, but should have as many as are appropriate!

---

## Project Description

This project visualizes the US national parksâ€™ location on a  choropleth map in web browser using Flask. The project will allow users to see the density of national parks in 51 states of the US. Click on the map to access a full list of national parks at the clicked state (also accessible by directly type in URLs). Update the density choropleth map as user filter through various park types.

Data Source: www.nps.gov

## How to run

1. pip install required modules from requirements.txt
2. run SI507project_tool_database

## How to use

1. Open a browser, go to address http://localhost:5000/
2. Click on the state name on the choropleth US map to see all the parks in that state
3. Return to the home page, click on one park type to see an updated choropleth US map.

## Routes in this application
- `/home` -> The overall national park density among all the US states visualized as a choropleth map.
- `/state/(state name)` -> A list of all the national parks in a specific state.
- `/type/(park type)` -> The density of a specific park type across all US states as a choropleth map.

## How to run tests
1. Find the test file SI507project_test.py
2. Run the test file
